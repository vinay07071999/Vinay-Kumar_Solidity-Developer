1.Token Airdrop Smart Contract (Solidity):
===========================================
 implementation of a Token Airdrop Smart Contract in Solidity and a simple React webpage with Web3 
 integration for MetaMask connection. 
 This example assumes you're using the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) TestNet.

2.React Webpage:
============================
 Install required dependencies before running the React app:
npm install web3 react-web3-hook.


In this code, replace 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' and CONTRACT_ABI with the actual address and ABI of 
your deployed smart contract. Additionally, ensure that you've configured your 
MetaMask for the BSC TestNet and have acquired test BNB and CAKE tokens for testing.

Output:
===========
After deploying the smart contract and running the React app, you can use the provided UI to connect MetaMask, 
enter the token address, airdrop amount, and recipient addresses. 
Upon clicking the "Execute Airdrop" button, MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. 
Once confirmed, the airdrop should be executed, and you will receive alerts indicating the success
or failure of the operation.
Ensure you have sufficient test BNB and CAKE tokens in your MetaMask wallet on the BSC TestNet for 
successful transactions.
